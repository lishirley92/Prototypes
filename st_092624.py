# The guideline will be structured as a JSON and will contain the following five components as keys: "Title", "Description", "Rules", "Examples of Good Writing", "Examples of Bad Writing."

# INPUT TEXT
# The input text will be an excerpt from some technical documentation that may need revision. The input text may be one sentence, one paragraph, or a few paragraphs. It will be written in AsciiDoctor format.

# OUTPUT RESPONSE
# Your task is to evaluate whether or not the input text follows the guideline. Please output your response as a JSON with the following components as keys: "Title" (of the Guideline), "Evaluation", "Instance 1" (if applicable), "Instance 2" (if applicable).

# - If the input text follows the guideline, under "Evaluation" write "No issues found." Otherwise, write "Issues found."
# - If the input text does not follow the guideline, choose 1-2 instances to focus on.
